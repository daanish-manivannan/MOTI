# MOTI
This project introduces MOTI (Multilingual Open Threat Intelligence), a robust and scalable cyberbullying detection system built on Google Colab. Leveraging the power of DistilBERT architecture and automated analysis, MOTI tackles cyberbullying across diverse online platforms, effectively handling instances regardless of language. Surpassing traditional methods, MOTI achieves superior accuracy in identifying cyberbullying content through advanced machine learning techniques, while its scalability on Google Colab makes it suitable for analyzing massive datasets from large online communities. Recognizing the importance of human oversight and ethical considerations, MOTI emphasizes the need for integration with existing reporting mechanisms for appropriate action against perpetrators. Additionally, future advancements will focus on ensemble learning, Explainable AI integration for transparency, seamless reporting system integration for streamlined response, and user education programs to create a comprehensive approach towards combating cyberbullying and fostering a safer online environment.

# MOTI Implementation üöÄ

This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and interpret data from the **Ministry of Trade and Industry (MOTI)**. The goal is to process, translate, and extract insights from multilingual text data using Python, NLP models, and visualization tools.

## üìå Objective

- Handle multilingual MOTI data
- Perform text preprocessing and translation
- Use NLP models for tasks like summarization, classification, and sentiment analysis
- Provide visual insights into the data
